# `binary`

A standard Node executable will receive two additional arguments that are often omitted:

- the node executable path
- the command path

`cmd-ts` provides a small helper that ignores the first two positional arguments that a command receives:

```ts
import { binary, command, run } from 'cmd-ts-too;

const myCommand = command({
  /* ... */
});
const binaryCommand = binary(myCommand);
run(binaryCommand, process.argv);
```
